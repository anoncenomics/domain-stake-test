# Repository Cleanup Plan (COMPLETED)

✅ **COMPLETED CLEANUP ACTIONS:**

**Scripts Organization:**
- Archived legacy/one-off scripts to `scripts/archive/`
- Kept only essential scripts: `optimized-comprehensive-backfill.mjs`, `migrate-sqlite-json-to-supabase.mjs`, `monitor-once.mjs`, `export-db-to-json.mjs`

**RPC Toolkit Relocation:**
- Moved `rpc-toolkit/` → `tools/rpc-toolkit/`
- Kept essential files: `README.md`, `NODE_SETUP.md`, `setup.sh`, `test-node-connection.mjs`
- Archived redundant backfills/diagnostics to `tools/rpc-toolkit/archive/`
- Scrubbed configs: sanitized `.env.*` and `docker-compose.yml` to example endpoints

**Documentation Consolidation:**
- Moved migration backups/artifacts to `documentation/archive/`
- Kept single `documentation/MIGRATION_HANDOFF_REPORT.md`
- Removed duplicate SQL files from root

**Repository Hygiene:**
- Deleted legacy import assets: `supabase_import.sh`, `supabase_import_chunks/`
- Removed duplicate SQL files: `consolidated_final_analytics.sql`, `final_verification.sql`
- Trimmed `package.json` scripts to active minimal set
- Strengthened `.gitignore` for data files and backups

**Result:** Clean, organized repository ready for next developer with essential tools preserved and sensitive configs sanitized.
